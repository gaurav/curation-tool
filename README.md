# Curation Tool

The Curation Tool will be designed to allow users to curate phyloreferences from phylogenetic publications, in which phyloreferences are recorded (using the data model in the [Phyloreferencing specification](https://github.com/phyloref/specification/blob/master/specification.md)) as well as phylogenies from the same publication, with annotations to indicate where the phyloreferences are expected to resolve. These can then optionally be uploaded to the [Curation Workflow](https://github.com/phyloref/curation-workflow/) for use in continuous testing.

While the Curation Tool is being developed, you can [see design previews](designs/) for the Curation Tool.
